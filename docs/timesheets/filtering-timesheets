# Filtering Time Sheets

Filtering time sheet data helps you quickly find the information you need.  Whether you're reviewing hours, checking approvals, or analyzing project activity.
## How to Apply Filters
You can filter data using several dropdown menus at the top of the page:

- User, select one or more.
- Groups, select one. (Note: your organization may use custom labels for this field)
- Projects, select one or more. (Custom labels may apply)
- Tasks, select one or more. (Custom labels may apply)

Additionally, you can filter by date ranges:
This / Next Week
This / Next Pay Period
This / Next Month
This / Next Year


Tag based filters


Below the dropdowns, you'll find tag filters for specific time categories:
Approved
Breaks
Standard
Overtime
Doubletime
PTO
A filter is active when a checkmark appears next to its name.
